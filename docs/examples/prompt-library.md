## Tips for Using These Prompts

### Customization

- Replace colors with your brand colors
- Adjust component counts to your needs
- Add or remove sections as needed
- Specify different platforms (mobile/tablet/desktop)

### Combining Prompts

You can combine elements from multiple prompts:
```
Take the hero section from "SaaS Product Landing Page" 
and combine it with the features section from "Agency Portfolio Landing Page"
```

### Refinement

Start with a base prompt, then refine:
1. Generate the base design
2. Ask for style adjustments
3. Add or remove specific elements
4. Fine-tune spacing and colors

### Platform-Specific

Add platform requirements:
```
[Any prompt above] 
Make this responsive and mobile-first, with a hamburger menu on mobile
```

### Framework-Specific

Specify your target framework:
```
[Any prompt above]
Optimize for React with reusable components and TypeScript types
```

## Prompt Writing Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Include exact counts and names
2. **Describe Layout**: Mention columns, grids, sections clearly
3. **Include Style**: Colors, spacing, visual style
4. **List Components**: Name specific UI elements
5. **Mention Interactions**: Hover effects, animations, states
6. **Consider Responsive**: Mention mobile behavior
7. **Think Accessibility**: Color contrast, semantic HTML
